1). My game is a simple 5 level maze. You must guide your mouse safely through the pathways to reach the green box at the end. You must complete all 5 levels in one try to complete "The Maze Game"

Extra:
If the invisible pathway is too hard, you can remove it by comment coding lines:
- 222
- 308
- 309

This should remove all invisible pathways (although it's cheating and not how the game is supposed to be played)

2). My program is a simple 5 level game that provides players with entertainment and teaches perseverance. It solves the problem of boredom and serves to purely entertain someone.

3). When you start the program, it loads up and displays a menu screen. Te main theme song will play, but it starts off quiet, so if you want to here a beautiful melody you should wait at least 5 seconds before continuing. Once the main menu appears, you will be presented with three options:
- Play (play the game)
- Instructions (how to play the game)
- Quit (Leave the Program)

Play: If you press play, the start menu will begin and the music stops. You must move your mouse cursor over the start button to begin, note that you will not have to click it. Make sure to be slow, as moving it to fast can reset the game. Once you start you will begin level one of the game. You only get one try to finish all 5 levels. If you hit the balck walls, the game restart back at the main menu. You must guide the mouse through the pathways to reach the green box which will start the fifth level. On completing the final level (level 5), a message box will apear with the message "You Win! Would You like to play again". If you choose yes the main menu should pop up, if you choose no, then program should close. Thats it!

Instruction: This will open up a small instructional screen for users to read in order to learn how to play my game. THere is a return button on the screen to leave once you have finished reading.

Quit: This button just exits the program

The buttons glow and should change colour when you hover over them to indicate to the user that the button is active and they are hovering over it.
